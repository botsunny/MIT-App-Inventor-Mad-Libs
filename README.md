# Science Libs!
A mobile version of the popular word game Mad Libs with a science theme, made using MIT App Inventor.

## Description
Mad Libs is a popular phrasal word game where a player asks another to state words of specified categories (eg. nouns, verbs, adjectives). These words are then filled into the 
blanks of a pre-written story, resulting in a complete, amusing and nonsensical story. Science Libs! is a mobile version of the game with a science 
theme. Instead of writing original stories, we took excerpts from popular scientific texts like Hawking's "A Brief History of Time" and put in blanks in place of certain words.
The user is then able to fill in these blanks and the result is an amusing modified version of an otherwise serious, academic text. Users are able to view the original excerpts
anytime to simultaneously gain bite-sized knowledge of the world of science. This fulfills our main purpose for creating this app: spreading scientific knowledge in a fun way.

This app was made as part of a pre-university project. Part of the project's purpose was to demonstrate our use of MIT App Inventor, a platform that kickstarts newbies into the
world of mobile app development by providing an easy tool in the form of Google Blocky, a popular block-based programming language.
